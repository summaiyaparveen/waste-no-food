# waste-no-food
A Waste -No -Food  web application to be built where people can register and become volunteers in contributing the details of the food where itâ€™s getting wasted. The major areas where food is wasted in restaurants and functions, marriages, people gatherings. This tracking of food can be done by maintaining communication with the restaurants, volunteers to let us know on the website about the places where food is getting wasted.  Then we have to classify the food waste based on the ingredients and nutrients in them to be served efficiently. Then provide to industries to whom the food is needed for their production.
